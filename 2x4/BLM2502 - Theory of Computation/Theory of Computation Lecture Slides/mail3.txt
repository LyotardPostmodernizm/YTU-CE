Hi all,



Deadline for the Homework 1 is extended to the 8th of April. You can upload one day late, with a penalty of 20 percents. Upload to the Dropbox File Request I sent you before. I will not accept any other (e.g. email) submissions.



For the next week, if I do not send you any message about how I will do the lecture, assume I will use our University online campus (UZEM) system.



Success
