Hi All,

* Homework 1 is due 1st of April 2020. You can submit one day late, in which case you will lose 20 points.

This time submission will be done digitally. For that SCAN your HANDWRITTEN solutions into a SINGLE PDF in the RIGHT ORDER and upload to https://www.dropbox.com/request/vlW8PNRsh3XbcxPSqIl1 . You can scan using your phone and a program like CamScanner. You can use their trial version, no problem if the submission has a bottom watermark. 

Write your solutions on the question sheet I share to you (print it first). Write using a black ink pen in a readable manner. IF I CANNOT READ, I DONT GIVE POINTS. Do your own quality control before submitting.

* This morning I tried to use the online classroom system provided by our university. Unfortunately the system became unavailable very quickly and I was not able to record a video.
I am evaluating the alternatives now, I will message you when I decide how I will continue on this.

* In the meantime, the slides I use, the homework, and all other resources are shared on the usual shared folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/88rqvue9mvwqu9x/AAC0LjaLf3QTPo0Eq9qyJNMVa?dl=0

The last slide we did is "060 CFL pumping.pptx"

Success,
Oguz Altun.
